This repository is designed to allow you too use things such as RFHA and SuperGriding etc.. 
Don't execute these scripts constantly, just execute them 1 at a time when needed, for example if I'm
on the slope in luigi circuit then you would use the SuperGrindRight script and it would supergrind you too the right once you finish super grinding cancel the script!
